### Better Installation Instructions
These instructions assume you use `pyenv` and `nvm`.
If you do not already have these, it is best to read first about why you may want to use these tools 
[here](https://opensource.com/article/19/5/python-3-default-mac) 
and [here](https://dev.to/melvnl/why-you-should-use-nvm-node-version-manager-and-how-to-install-it-52oh).
If you would rather not, go back to the [README](../README.md) and follow those instructions as that is sufficient.
